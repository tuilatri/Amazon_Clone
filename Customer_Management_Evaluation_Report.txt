================================================================================

3.1 STRENGTHS
-------------
• Clean, professional Amazon-style design
• Consistent color scheme (#232f3e header, #f0c14b buttons)
• Good use of whitespace and visual hierarchy
• Responsive grid layout adapts to screen sizes
• Smooth animations for modals (fadeIn)
• Intuitive icon usage (PersonIcon, SearchIcon, etc.)
• Status badges with distinct colors for quick recognition
• Debounced search inputs prevent excessive API calls

3.2 INPUT SIZING & SPACING
--------------------------
• Search inputs: max-width 180px, padding 8px 12px - ADEQUATE
• Modal inputs: 100% width with 10px 12px padding - GOOD
• Date inputs: proper padding with calendar icon - GOOD
• Select dropdowns: properly sized with cursor: pointer
• Gap spacing: 8px between grid cells, consistent throughout

3.3 READABILITY
---------------
• Font sizes: 13-15px for content, appropriate hierarchy
• Header labels: uppercase, 13px, 600 weight - GOOD
• Cell text: ellipsis for overflow, preventing layout break

3.4 MINOR UI ISSUES OBSERVED
----------------------------
• Date inputs could benefit from clear/reset capability
• Long email addresses may be truncated (handled with ellipsis)
• Order history table in modal could have column resizing

================================================================================
                     5. MISSING FEATURES & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

5.1 HIGH PRIORITY (Recommended Additions)
-----------------------------------------
❌ COLUMN SORTING - No ability to sort by any column
   Recommendation: Add ascending/descending sort for Username, Email, 
   Registered Date, Last Active Date

❌ DATE RANGE FILTERS - Current filters only allow single date
   Recommendation: Add "From" and "To" date pickers for registration 
   and last active date filtering

❌ EXPORT FUNCTIONALITY - No way to export user data
   Recommendation: Add CSV/Excel export button for filtered results

❌ PASSWORD RESET TRIGGER - Admin cannot trigger password reset for users
   Recommendation: Add "Send Password Reset Email" action in user profile

5.2 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice-to-Have)
----------------------------------
❌ BULK ACTIONS - Cannot select multiple users for batch operations
   Recommendation: Add checkboxes with bulk status change capability

❌ ADVANCED SEARCH - No combined filter logic indicator
   Recommendation: Show active filter count or "pills" that can be removed

❌ USER ACTIVITY LOG - No history of user actions/changes
   Recommendation: Add activity timeline or audit log per user

❌ QUICK STATS - No summary statistics at top of page
   Recommendation: Display total users, active today, new this week

❌ REFRESH DATA - No manual refresh button for the list
   Recommendation: Add refresh icon button near pagination

5.3 LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancement)
-------------------------------------
❌ PROFILE PICTURE MANAGEMENT - Only default avatar icon
   Recommendation: Support for user profile image display

❌ ADDRESS DISPLAY IN PROFILE - Backend returns addresses but not shown
   Recommendation: Add addresses section in profile popup

❌ USER NOTES - No way to add admin notes about users
   Recommendation: Add internal notes field visible only to admins

❌ USER DELETION/ARCHIVAL - No delete functionality
   Note: This may be intentionally omitted for data integrity
