4. POTENTIAL RISKS OR LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

4.1 SCALABILITY CONCERNS
    - Client-side sorting of orders (line 98-100 in UserManagement.js)
      may cause performance issues with users having many orders
    - No virtual scrolling or lazy loading for large user lists
    - Full data fetch on each filter change could strain the server
    
4.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
    - No confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
    - Status changes happen immediately without audit logging
    - Password not editable by admin (intentionally secure, but limits support)
    
4.3 DATA INTEGRITY
    - Email uniqueness validation appears absent from frontend
    - Phone number format validation not comprehensive
    - Age field accepts any number (no min/max validation)
    
4.4 ERROR HANDLING
    - Generic error messages ("Failed to update user")
    - Limited feedback on validation errors
    - No retry mechanism for failed operations
    
4.5 UI/UX LIMITATIONS
    - No keyboard shortcuts for power users
    - No dark mode support
    - Modal can become crowded with all panels open
    - Product images in order detail show "No Image" placeholders
      (backend API doesn't return product images)

7. CONCLUSION
================================================================================

OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Partially Production-Ready

The User Management tab provides a solid foundation with essential features:
viewing, searching, filtering, editing users, and inspecting order history.
The UI is clean and consistent with the overall admin design.

However, several critical features are missing for a full production system:
- Role/permission management
- User deletion
- Audit logging
- Bulk operations
- Export functionality

RECOMMENDATION: Address Priority 1 items before production deployment to ensure
compliance, security, and administrative efficiency. The current implementation
is suitable for development/staging environments and limited user bases.
