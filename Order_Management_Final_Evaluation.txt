================================================================================
SECTION 2: IDENTIFIED GAPS & LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

2.1 STILL MISSING (Important)
-----------------------------
FEATURE: Order Notes / Admin Comments
- Cannot add internal notes to orders
- No way to document customer communications
- Impact: Limits admin workflow for complex cases
Priority: MEDIUM

FEATURE: Order History / Audit Trail
- No visibility into status change history
- Cannot see who changed status or when
- Impact: Difficult to track order lifecycle
Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH

FEATURE: Quick Stats Dashboard
- No summary statistics in Order Management tab
- Must switch to Overview for counts
- Impact: Reduced admin efficiency
Priority: LOW-MEDIUM

2.2 MINOR GAPS (Nice-to-have)
-----------------------------
FEATURE: Print / Invoice Generation
- Only CSV export available
- No printable order summary or invoice
Priority: LOW

FEATURE: Advanced Search
- Cannot search by product name within orders
- Cannot search by amount range
Priority: LOW

FEATURE: Saved Filter Presets
- Filters reset on page reload
- No way to save common filter combinations
Priority: LOW

FEATURE: Real-time Updates
- Orders don't auto-refresh
- Manual refresh required for external changes
Priority: LOW

2.3 NO LONGER GAPS (Recently Resolved)
--------------------------------------
✓ Individual Order Status Change - IMPLEMENTED (inline dropdown)
✓ User-Initiated Returns - IMPLEMENTED (/Orders page)
✓ Returned as Final State - IMPLEMENTED (Admin lock)
✓ CSV Export - IMPLEMENTED (client-side generation)
✓ Bulk Action Restrictions - IMPLEMENTED (final state protection)

================================================================================
SECTION 3: RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

3.1 DATA INTEGRITY RISKS
------------------------
RISK: No server-side validation for Admin status changes
Level: LOW
Current State: Frontend enforces final state rules
Recommendation: Backend should also reject invalid transitions

RISK: Hard-coded payment/shipping method mappings
Level: LOW
Current State: Mappings defined in frontend code
Recommendation: Fetch dynamically from backend

3.2 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------
STATUS: ADEQUATE for course project
- User can only return their own orders (verified by email)
- Admin cannot initiate returns (correct separation)
- Status changes require authenticated session

3.3 OPERATIONAL RISKS
---------------------
RISK: No audit trail
Level: MEDIUM
Impact: Cannot trace who made changes or when
Current Mitigation: None

RISK: No order notes
Level: LOW-MEDIUM
Impact: Lost context for complex orders
Current Mitigation: None

3.4 SCALABILITY CONCERNS
------------------------
CONCERN: Client-side CSV generation
Level: LOW
Current State: Works for moderate order volumes
For Production: Should use server-side export with streaming

================================================================================
SECTION 8: CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The Order Management tab has reached a mature state suitable for:
- Academic project submission
- Demo/presentation purposes
- Moderate production use with noted caveats

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
1. Full order visibility with comprehensive filtering
2. Inline status editing with proper final state locking
3. User-initiated returns with role separation
4. Bulk operations with business rule enforcement
